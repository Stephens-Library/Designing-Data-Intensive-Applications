## Part I. Foundations of Data Systems
- The first four chapters go through the fundamental ideas that apply to all data systems, whether running on a single machine or distributed across a cluster of machines

1. Chapter 1: Introduces the termininology and approach that's going to be used through the book
2. Chapter 2: Compares several different data models and query languages, the most visible distinguishing factor between databases from a developer's point of view
3. Chapter 3: Turns to the internals of strage engines and looks at how databases lay out data on disk, different storage engines are optimized for different workloads, and choosing the right one can have a huge effect on performance
4. Chapter 4: Compares various formats for data encoding (serializaton) and examines how they fare in an environment where application requirements change and schemas need to adapt over time
